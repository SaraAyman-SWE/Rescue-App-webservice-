# Rescue-App

On transport, many issues can happen like if your car suddenly breaks down on the road, or an accident happens. First thing you will be doing is finding someone to help you,
especially if you are travelling between two cities. It becomes harder to find help. This will lead to wasting your time to find a rescuer or someone to pull you up to a mechanic.
Having a car is always very convenient in many ways, but how to maintain your car is a harder question. It does not matter whether you have an old vehicle as long as you were able 
to take good care of it and regularly check up on it. Most use their cars daily but tend to set aside having it checked regularly. These hesitations may lead to minor to 
major repairs jobs, and worst to accidents. A car is usually serviced each 5,000 KM and needs to be looked into by a professional. It must be done to maintain longer 
life span for the motor and for the car.

## Project Objective
This project aims towards helping the people easily find help for their cars whenever they need it at any time. Specially that it is now a very difficult task to 
find a mechanic after 6 PM in Egypt. So, this project is aiming towards providing a rescue for the customerâ€™s car anywhere at any time in Egypt. 
Also, it makes it easier to get a mechanic to fix your car or do your maintenance while you are at your home without you taking it to a repairs center.
